  ## Description
For the senior project, the team had decided to make a VR game set in a not so distant future where crime is at an all time high. Similar to the infamous Manhunt game, the player will be placed in a run-down prison and instructed to find the targets and eliminate them. This can be done by using the 3 pistols at the playerâ€™s disposal. This allows the player to store 3 weapons in their backpack using the built-in UI and possibly dual-wield them too. 
As for the project itself, it consists of two scenes, one of which is the menu scene which takes place in the laboratory. This is where the player can take control of the robot character and learn the controls before going into the prison itself. There is a canvas in front of the spawn location which will give more information on the controls and actions that are able to be done. Once the player feels that they are ready, they will collide with the white cube and be placed in the prison near the weapons truck for them to begin. Seeing as the game has been constructed in a sandbox design, there is no number or timer. Which means that the player can freely move around the prison without any repercussions.
